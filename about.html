        <h1> A Life <br>Spent <br> Learning</h1>
        
        <div id="about-text">
            <p>An irritating jumble of broken links started my <strong>obsession with programming. </strong></p> 
            <p>While working as a salesman for a wine importer, I realized we needed to modernize our website and fix all those broken links.
            As I began exploring web devleopement, our page views increased, my <strong>sales doubled,</strong> and I realized how much I enjoyed learning to code. </p>
            
            <p> Soon, I found myself spending <strong>all my free time writing code. </strong> 
            </p>
            <p>Then Corona came.
            </p>
            <p>Covid-19 has crippled the hospitality industry I love. But I took this catastrophe as an opportunity to <strong>launch a new career</strong> in web development. 
            </p>
            <p>Originally from California, I studied Spanish and Portguese at UC Berkeley. After school, I worked for years as an English teacher and translator in Madrid, Spain.</p>
            <p>Later I moved to Stockholm, working for many years as a sommelier, server and, finally, in the wine import trade. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Constant learning</strong> has been the throughline of my life. In 8 different countries, I have worked with everything from sports reporting to farming fruit. I love meeting new people and especially trying new foods.  
            </p>
            <p>Aside from programming, I spend my free time playing with my two daughters and cooking extravagant meals with my wife.
