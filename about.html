          <!-- rock paper scissors -->
            <p>A little girl pushed me into programming.</p>
            
            <p>While working as a salesman for a wine importer, I wanted to modernize our website so I took on the <strong>challenge of learning</strong> web development. 
              My first project was a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game that my daughter and I played. She absolutely loved it and asked me what else I could make.   
            </p>
           
            <p> Soon, I found myself spending <strong>all my free time writing code. </strong> 
            </p>
            <p>At the same time as I expanded our wine import business into 5 new cities and more than <strong>doubled 
              my sales </strong>year on year, I developed my coding skills with a special focus on React. 
            </p>
            <p>Then Corona came.
            </p>
            
            <p>Covid-19 has crippled the hospitality industry I love. But I took this catastrophe as an opportunity to <strong>launch a new career</strong> in web development. 
            </p>
            <p>Originally from California, I studied Spanish and Portguese at UC Berkeley. After school, I worked for years as an English teacher and translator in Madrid, Spain.
            Later I moved to Stockholm, working for many years as a sommelier, server and, finally, in the wine import trade. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>Constant learning</strong> has been the throughline of my life. In 8 different countries, I have worked with everything from sports reporting to farming fruit. I love meeting new people and especially trying new foods.  
            </p>
            <p>Aside from programming, I spend my free time playing with my two daughters and cooking extravagant meals with my wife.
